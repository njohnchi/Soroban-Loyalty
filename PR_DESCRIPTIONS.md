## PR #2: Add Network Status Monitoring and Indicator

### Branch: `feature/network-status-indicator-59`

### Title
Add network status monitoring with real-time health checks

### Description

This PR adds comprehensive network status monitoring to provide users with visibility into the Stellar network connection and application health. Users can now see when the network is degraded or unreachable, preventing failed transaction attempts.

#### Changes Made

**Backend:**
- Enhanced `/health` endpoint with Stellar network and database connectivity checks
- Added latency measurements and detailed health status reporting
- Integrated with existing Soroban RPC and PostgreSQL connections

**Frontend:**
- Created `NetworkStatusIndicator` component with green/yellow/red status dots
- Implemented `useNetworkStatus` hook with 30-second polling interval
- Added `NetworkBanner` component for degraded/unreachable states
- Integrated status indicator into application header
- Disabled claim/redeem buttons when network is unreachable
- Added accessible status indicators (color + icon + text)
- Tooltip displays last checked time

#### Accessibility
- Status uses color + icon + text (not color alone)
- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Screen reader compatible
- Keyboard accessible

#### Testing
- ✅ Verified health endpoint returns proper status codes
- ✅ Confirmed 30-second polling interval
- ✅ Tested button disabling when network unreachable
- ✅ Validated accessibility with screen readers (NVDA)
- ✅ Tested network degradation scenarios

#### Files Changed
- `backend/src/index.ts` - Enhanced health endpoint
- `frontend/src/hooks/useNetworkStatus.ts` - Network monitoring hook
- `frontend/src/components/NetworkStatusIndicator.tsx` - Status indicator
- `frontend/src/components/NetworkBanner.tsx` - Warning banner
- `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` - Integrated status indicator
- `frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Disabled buttons when offline
- `frontend/src/app/globals.css` - Network status styles

#### Performance Impact
- Minimal: 30-second polling interval with 5-second timeout
- Health checks are lightweight (< 100ms typical response time)
- No impact on user interactions

Closes #59

2. **#59 (Network Status)** - Backend + Frontend, no dependencies
3. **#40 (Internationalization)** - Adds new dependencies, affects all components
4. **#60 (CSV Export)** - New feature, minimal conflicts
5. **#112 (Contract Upgrade)** - Critical security feature

Alternatively, all can be merged together if testing is done on a combined branch first.

## PR #112: Implement Contract Upgrade Mechanism with Timelock

### Branch: `feat/contract-upgrade-timelock`

### Title
Implement contract upgrade mechanism with 48-hour timelock and multi-sig

### Description
This PR introduces a secure governance layer for contract upgrades, ensuring that all WASM updates are subject to a mandatory timelock and multi-admin authorization.

#### Changes Made
- **Upgrade Proposal**: Added `propose_upgrade` to initiate an upgrade with a WASM hash.
- **Multi-sig (N-of-M)**: Implemented `authorize_upgrade` to collect signatures from multiple admins.
- **Timelock**: Enforced a 48-hour delay (172,800 seconds) between proposal and execution.
- **Emergency Controls**: Added `cancel_upgrade` for authorized admins to abort pending proposals.
- **Transparency**: Integrated indexer-friendly events (`UPG_PROP`, `UPG_AUTH`, `UPG_EXEC`, `UPG_CAN`).
- **Initialization**: Updated `initialize` to accept a vector of admins and a signature threshold.

#### Testing
- ✅ Unit tests for the full upgrade lifecycle
- ✅ Verification of timelock and threshold constraints
- ✅ Event emission validation

Closes #112
